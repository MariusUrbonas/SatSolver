# SatSolver

The okSAT solver implements some of the most common techniques found in current state of the art SAT solvers such as miniSAT.

# Possible improvements
Some possible improvements that werenâ€™t implemented are clause deletion, where too long and rarely used clauses are discarded to save memory and avoid unnecessary computation. Some preprocessing done of the formula to identify possibly separate subsets of clauses of the formula also can improve the speed of the solution.
